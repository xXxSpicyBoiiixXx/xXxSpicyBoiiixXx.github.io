# Personal blog done on github pages

Personal blog about life, PhD, and other neat things I learn on the way! Don't you think it's pretty neat that github let's you just create a webstie? I do have a more professional website, but this is for fun! 

Things that would be included 

- Personal Life
- PhD Journey
- Things that are in the now
- Math stuff (I personally really really love math, crazy right?) 
- Physics stuff (Hey? It's my first undergraduate degree lol)
- MEMES
- Coding, tips, tricks, and all that fun stuff
- Extra things that I think are relevant
- Feel free to contact me for any requested material

Here's the website below as well as my professional one, I hope you enjoy!

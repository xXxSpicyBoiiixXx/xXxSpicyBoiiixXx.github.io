## Welcome to my personal blog! 

My name is Md Ali and I'm based in the city of Chicago. I have a deep passion for continous learning, currently I am a PhD student in Computer Science but I am also interested in the aspects of mathematics and phyiscs. Overall this is more of my personal life as well as my journey through academia starting from the very beginning until now. There will also be free resources and such for learning as it helps me to teach material to have a deeper understanding than just class work. (I'm looking at you lol we all skimp out on actual classwork and I'm also an unconvential learner). Overall, welcome to my blog and I'm glad you spent the time to come see it!

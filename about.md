nks for visiting, my name is Md Ali (I think you got that from the homepage obviously) and this is my blog. This is mainly a personal blog about me, math, science, etc. Now I know what you're thinking, ewww math, what the fuck, science, really Md? But trust me this will be really infromal way of showing neat shit. In addition, I'm just going to start this by doing a personal blog. This page specfically is more about who I am, what I do, and all that good stuff!

Now for the fun stuff more about me and how I ended up on the track of doing a PhD in the first place (probably the smartest and not smartest life choices but I don't regret the descion at all).

I grew up in the beautiful town of Lake Jackson, Texas. There really isn't much here to see or even go do, except for the town's logo that the city itself should changed to the "City of Entrapment". Unfortuantly, they went with the "City of ENchancement" as you can see below. (If you ever visit or driving past here, right behind this sign is almost always a cop, so be careful while flying past the empty highways of Texas).

In all fairness, there is quite a few churches here as well as a very safe area. There is a lot of history that I won't really bore you with but if you're looking to have more of a right leaning, safe, and christian household this would be the place for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for more a diverse community, educational growth, or career options this may not be the best suited for someone that needs more of that type of quick pace life style. Overall, as much as I hated living here and the boredom will kill you, I will say this is my hometown and there is nostalgic memories that will always be with me. 

As I've said, in terms of educational growth, this isn't the area but my educational aspiration really took off when I was ... (finish personal memo for high school physics stuff later)
